4. How can we create a nested webpage in HTML?
When the content of one completely different webpage is embedded into another webpage, it is called a nested webpage. The nested webpage can be created using the following 2 methods:

<iframe> tag: The iframe in HTML stands for Inline Frame. The “iframe” tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders.
<embed> tag: The <embed> tag in HTML is used for embedding external applications which are generally multimedia content like audio or video into an HTML document.
