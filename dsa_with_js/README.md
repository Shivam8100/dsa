# dsa
here i am solving dsa question with some different approachs.
# what is javascript?
-Brindan Eich created first javascript engine.
- one callstack and a heap.
->one thread --->one call stack --->one thing at a time.

## event loop
just a simple job --> look at the webapis and task queue-->stack-->popoff
event lop waits for call stack to be clear so even if we put 0ms in setTimeout it still calls and go through with event loop.
